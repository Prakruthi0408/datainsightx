# datainsightx

`datainsightx` is a lightweight Python package that generates automated summaries and visual reports from transactional datasets. It's designed to help analysts and stakeholders quickly understand key patterns in their data â€” with minimal setup.

The tool detects useful columns, calculates relevant KPIs, creates visualizations, and saves the outputs as plain text, JSON, and HTML files.

- Highlights top categories based on value
- Creates visual charts for trends and category distribution
- Exports:
  - A text summary
  - A structured JSON report
  - A full HTML report with embedded visualizations

## How to use

1. Place your CSV file in the working directory.
2. Call the `run_insight()` function with the CSV file path.

```python
from core import run_insight

run_insight("your_file.csv")
